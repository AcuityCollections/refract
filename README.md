### Master your app's side-effects through the power of streams.

Observe any producer, cause any effect. Refract lets you observe anything within your app - changes to props, data passed to callbacks, dispatched redux actions, updated redux state, window event listeners, and much more. Using your chosen stream library, you react to the streams of events, and produce any effect you choose.
