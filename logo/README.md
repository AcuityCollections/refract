## Modifications

Whenever possible, use the originals provided on this page.

If for some reason you must change how the title is rendered and can't use the prerendered version we provide, we ask that you use the free [Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) font, and ensure there is enough space between the symbol and the title.
